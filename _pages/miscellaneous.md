I love long-distance running and photography in my spare time, though Iâ€™m a novice in both (and probably always will be).

I finished my [first official half marathon race](/assets/miscellaneous/philly_half_2024.pdf) in Philadelphia Marathon Weekend 2024. It was an amazing and beautiful course along many historical sites in Philadelphia!
