I am interested in studying <ins>AI-empowered medical imaging acquisition, processing, and interpretation</ins> to transform medical research and clinical practice. My research is multidisciplinary, building on techniques in ***deep learning***, ***computer vision***, and ***medical imaging*** to design and deploy open-source frameworks in medical / clinical research communities, with the goal of *assisting large-scale and cross-modality clinical studies* to discover quantitative image-based markers and thereby improve healthcare.

Recently, I have focused on ***self-supervised learning*** and ***domain adaptation***.

**TL;DR:** Computer Vision & Deep Learning in Medical Imaging = Intelligent Vision in Healthcare
