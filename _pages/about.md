I am interested in studying <ins>AI-empowered medical imaging acquisition, processing, and interpretation</ins> to transform medical research and clinical practice. My research is multidisciplinary, building on techniques in ***deep learning***, ***computer vision***, and ***medical imaging***. I am interested in developing robust vision models for medical image analysis and computing. My research focused on generative models, self-/semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised domain adaptation. Recently, I have been exploring the (large) vision model and vision language model. 

On the application side, I focused on deploying open-source frameworks in medical / clinical research communities, with the goal of *assisting large-scale medical or clinical studies* to discover quantitative image-based markers and thereby improve healthcare.

**TL;DR:** Computer Vision & AI in Medical Imaging = Intelligent Vision in Healthcare
