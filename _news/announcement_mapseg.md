Our recent work on self-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation for heterogeneous medical image segmentation is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09373.pdf): *MAPSeg: Unified Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Heterogeneous Medical Image Segmentation Based on 3D **M**asked **A**utoencoding and **P**seudo-Labeling*. **MAPSeg** is the first **unified** UDA framework that works for centralized, federated, and test-time UDA.
